# NotebookLM Clone
In this project we build an open-source implementation of Google's NotebookLM that grounds AI responses in your documents with accurate citations. Built with modern AI technologies including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector databases, and conversational memory.

## Overview

NotebookLM Clone is a document-grounded AI assistant that allows you to:

- Upload and process multiple document types (PDF, text, audio, YouTube videos, web pages)
- Ask questions and receive cited, verifiable answers
- Maintain conversational context intelligently across sessions
- Generate AI podcasts from your documents
- Clean and intuitive web interface inspired by NotebookLM

### Tech Stack

- PyMuPDF for complex document parsing with PDF, TXT and Markdown support.
- AssemblyAI for audio transcription with speaker diarization.
- Firecrawl for scraping and content extraction from websites.
- Milvus vector database for efficient semantic search.
- Zep's temporal knowledge graphs as the memory layer.
- Kokoro as the open source Text-to-Speech model.
- Streamlit for the interactive web UI.

### NotebookLM UI

- NotebookLM-Inspired Design: Three-Panel Layout with sources panel, chat interface, and studio features.
- Add your documents via the Upload panel.
- Interactive source citations with detailed metadata in chat responses.
- Podcast Generation: AI podcast creation with script generation and multi speaker TTS

## Architecture

![architecture-diagram](assets/flow-diagram.jpg)

## Data Flow
1. Document Ingestion: User uploads PDF, audio, video, text, or web URL
2. Processing: Content extracted with metadata (page numbers, timestamps, and other metadata)
3. Chunking: Text split into overlapping segments preserving context
4. Embedding: Chunks converted to vector representations
5. Storage: Vectors stored in Milvus with citation metadata
6. Query: User asks question → Query embedded → Semantic search
7. Retrieval: Top-k relevant chunks retrieved with metadata
8. Generation: Agent generates cited response using memory
9. Memory: Conversation saved to Zep for future context

## Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11
    
1. **Install dependencies:**
    First, install `uv` and set up the environment:
    ```bash
    # MacOS/Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # Windows
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Create a new directory for our project
    uv init notebook-lm
    cd notebook-lm

    # Create virtual environment and activate it
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux

    .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

    # Install dependencies
    uv sync

    # Additional steps (recommended)
    uv add -U yt-dlp           # for latest version
    uv pip install pip         # pip for TTS model dependencies
    ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file with your API keys as specified in `.env.example` file:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
   ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY>
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=<YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY>
   ZEP_API_KEY=<YOUR_ZEP_API_KEY>
   # If Hugging Face is slow or unavailable in your network:
   HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   ```

   Get the API keys here:
   - [Assembly AI →](https://www.assemblyai.com/)，google邮箱
   - [Zep AI →](https://www.getzep.com/)，github登录
   - [Firecrawl →](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)，GitHub登录
   - [OpenAI →](https://openai.com)，openRouter


## Usage
Running the Web Application
```python
uv run streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open at http://localhost:8501

The first startup downloads the local embedding model. `HF_ENDPOINT` avoids
the common Hugging Face connection timeout; subsequent startups use the cache.

Chat and podcast script generation call the OpenAI-compatible API. If the
default endpoint is not reachable from your network, set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` in
`.env` to the API gateway provided by your school or proxy service.
